We here at PY4E use Google Accounts as our sole login.
We do not want to spend a lot of time verifying identity, resetting passwords,
detecting robot-login storms, and other issues so we let Google do that hard work.ffff</p>
<p>
So you must have a Google account and we will require your
name and email address to login.  We do not need and do not receive your password - only Google
will ask you for your password.  When you press login, you will be directed to the Google
authentication system where you will be given the option to share your
information with PY4E.
